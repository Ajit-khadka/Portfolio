"Hello everyone,

I'm excited to share with you a portfolio that I've been working on, inspired by the incredible work of Stefan Topalovic. After watching a codingPhase portfolio review video some time ago, I was truly captivated by Stefan's design skills. With utmost respect and admiration, I decided to challenge myself by recreating the design using HTML, CSS, and JS.

This project has been a great learning experience for me, and I hope I've done justice to the original inspiration. Full credit goes to Stefan Topalovic for his amazing creativity and talent.

Feel free to check out CodingPhase video I was talking  about which I have linked below:
